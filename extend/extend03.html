            <h3>Modifying Images</h3>
            
            <!-- 1st paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to explain the importance of using descriptive file names for image files. Use complete sentences. -->
            <p>Image file names should be meaningful and reflect the purpose of the web page it will be used on and the descriptive content it represents.</p>
            
            <!-- 2nd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the application you used to change the size of the image. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>I used the program called "Canva" to edit the image size. This web tool is super easy and fun to use.</p>
            
            <!-- 3rd paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the original size of the image, in pixels. Use a complete sentence. -->
            <p>The original size of the the .jpg file was 2121 px width X 1414 px height.</p>
            
            <h4>Image Before Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image before compression, html5.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5.jpg" alt="handwriting HTML5 on glass" width="2121" height="1414">
            
            <!-- 4th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to identify the online image compressor you used to reduce the file size. What was the original image file size? What was the reduced image file size? Use complete sentences.  -->
            <p>I used <a href="https://compressor.io/" "target="_blank">compression.io</a> to reduce the file. The original size was 12 KB and was reduced to 7 KB.</p>
            
            <h4>Image After Compression</h4>
            <!-- Use image element below to insert the image after compression, html5_min.jpg -->
            <img src="images/html5_min.jpg" alt="handwriting HTML5 on glass" width="500" height="333">
            
            <!-- 5th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to note any visual changes that you can see between html5.jpg and html5_min.jpg -->
            <p>The compressed image is slightly less blurry than the original image.</p>

                <h3>SVG Graphics</h3>
                
                <!-- Insert your SVG code below this comment -->
                <svg width="100" height="100" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
                        <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" stroke="green" stroke-width="4" fill="yellow" />
               </svg>
                
                <!-- 6th paragraph element: Use the paragraph element below to provide information about the resource you used to help create your SVG image -->
                <p>I went to <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp"> w3schools</a> to learn how to create an .svg file</p>
